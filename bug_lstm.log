1. minst lstm -> work
2. input: like lstm   y int64  -> unit8  | x unit8  -> float32  not work
3. like minst: model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=128, verbose=1) ok
   so cancle        
        # validation_data=val_generator,
        # validation_steps=40,
   it's work



4. like minst: score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test,batch_size=128, verbose=1)

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: 2 root error(s) found.

not work 

 so the root cause is  model.evaluate
 bu not use lstm but cnn  , it's work
